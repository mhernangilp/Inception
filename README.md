## 💡 About the project

> _Inception is a system administration project designed to deepen your understanding
> of virtualization and container orchestration using Docker. You will build and manage a secure,
> containerized web infrastructure, entirely from scratch, within a Virtual Machine.
> Each service runs in its own Docker container and is orchestrated using Docker Compose._
